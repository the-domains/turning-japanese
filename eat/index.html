<p>Osaka style sushi remains the closest to the old style it was normal to fill the cavity with vinegered rice and press it, some times wrapped in bamboo leaf which has antibacterial properties. this is still prevalent using Saba mackerel which is salted vinegared rolled onto rice and topped with translucent seaweed traditionally wrapped in bamboo leaf as an antibacterial aid and to facilitate carriage .</p><p> There was no refrigeration so sushi in its modern form did not make an mass market appearance to much later in the transport links and refrigeration came to the fore, even Toro probably the most revered cut of the tuna is a recent introduction to the sushi pantheon. It was a government promotion to make use of all the tuna as before this cut was not eaten and discarded. </p><p> Product is all-important in Japan the source and the quality are of premium importance.</p><blockquote><p> A certain reverence is directed to the product be it a eel or a chicken I think Shinto has played a large part in this attitude everything has its own soul from a grain of rice to a tin can.</p></blockquote><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3acea0b01816c35459bbb6f0fe1a50bc79e3447.jpg" alt="" title=""><p>Respect for what you eat is slowly filtering back to Europe even in the mainstream.More people are eating better products and being educated into going out of their way to get a better tasting chicken that has had a better life and been treated with respect. </p><p> Japan has a greater respect-understanding for the seasons, the anticipation is palpable waiting for the start of Matsutake or Bamboo it is so important. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a0ff47e0-a6d3-4608-a079-3f6f97b342eb.jpg" alt="" title=""><p> An explosion of cherry blossom is a major celebration throughout Japan and as the trees blossom from the warmer south to the north a wave of matsuri celebrating the new beginning; sweep the country along with local seasonal foods being enjoyed again in their moment.</p><p> This is a very important yearly passage that the whole of Japan is totally gripped by,TV crews give daily reports from Yoshino on the state of the blossom.

<p> Sake Has made a return to popular culture but breweries are still closing now export of premium sake is starting to spiral as there is a global market for this wonderful product, it will save and promote the industry, this brings me back to the theory of the harder path makes things better. </p><p>Sake brewing is a difficult and physically intensive product but a wonderful flavour and depth just from rice and water koji and yeast hundreds of different flavours from the humble grain of rice. </p><p>Markets play an important part of the social structure of the Japanese not just buying food but keeping the farmers and producers funded holding the community together by meeting each other on a weekly basis, not of course forgetting the human need for the latest gossip. In addition, cooked food stalls yatai featuring local dishes rarely seen out side of their locale keeping the locals and food history intact, long may they continue. The big departo stores are full of historic foods, downstairs the food halls are filled with small independent specialists keeping food alive the products here are of great provenance and a high standard and many are produced in-store keeping it fresh and immediate. </p><picture>

<p>As a foreigner the standards reached in food production and presentation in Japan is totally unrivalled anywhere else in the world, there are more food programmes food literature and quality restaurants here than anywhere I can think of. The rest of the world is uneducated in the deep passion for food that the Japanese people have. So much so that when lists of the best restaurants are made as they are, invariably none contain any restaurant from Japan when my feeling is that the best are in fact all in Japan. </p><picture>

<p>Finally the Michelin guide has published the guide to Tokyo featuring more starred restaurants than Paris and this is only the first issue. I feel now slightly justified in my long held views , It is also why I travel to japan at every opportunity just to eat.</p><p> Japanese chefs work hard and have a respect for food from their culture and others hence some of the best French and Italian restaurants in Japan are headed up By Japanese chefs. </p><picture>
