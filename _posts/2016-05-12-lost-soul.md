Tsukiji has out grown its location and public health regulations can now not be enforced in such a rambling old building.

Masses of tourists including me stalking for photos, queuing for sushi and generally getting in the way, has in no way brought about the move.

The Market in real terms is worn out the worlds largest retail fish market and one of the oldest. 

Its not always been in the same place, it had taken many forms over the years right from the formation of a fish market by Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Edo period. A central market was formed in 1923 located in Nihonbashi. In the same year the great Kanto earthquake struck it then moved to its current location.

In terms of Japanese culture, renewal and replacement is a very shinto thing, Ise replaces its shrines every 20 years Tsukiji has managed 93 years.

The sushi shops will remain currently but there will be redevelopment in time for the 2020 olympics. The last day for the market will be the 7th of November, I will be there to pay my respects.
