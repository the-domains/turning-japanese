Some of my Favorite places are not just in Tokyo they are scattered around Japan.

I love small hidden away places or old established shops, the very local or for the salaryman. Atmosphere is always exiting the food is always good and they all have a great history and honesty that the new wave cannot offer;Yet!

That takes time. In Tokyo Akitaya has been around for 60 years and I have been visiting for twenty they just grill. open onto the street , they are easily located, when you reach the subway at Daimon the smell of Bincho (charcoal) invades you nostrils and somehow it works like a tractor beam and I'm pulled up the stairs on a cloud of grilling pork parts. they are located on the corner in a reconstructed building.

> The original was sold to a developer and they rebuilt the site and now two floors and not so much patina of time and smoke stuck to the walls. I visited when it reopened I commented that all the atmosphere had disappeared up the new lift-shaft.

The original chefs. have now retired, there sons who were once the waiters are now cooking, the Japanese tradition of the generations following in the footsteps of each other continues here.

They cook all pork here good quality with the charcoal edge permeating everything, who cares about carcinogens when things taste this good. One of the classics here is there tsukune minced pork formed round a skewer and grilled dotted with pork cartilage and nutty crunchy texture excites the palate dusted with nori powder and limited to one each. Get one on the first order they sometimes run out. Along with this is the eternal pot, Motsu a stew of pork internals slowly simmered legend the stock has been added to over the decades and some of the original remains,Im not so sure but it is unwavering in its great flavour, topped with shredded negs and a dusting of Japanese chilli powder.

Formica makes its presence known here squares of the material perched atop upturned beer crates make constructed tables for the street diners standing drinking and snacking. there is a kitchen at the back this is populated by grandmothers cooking the extra dishes preping pickles and various other goodies that cannot be grilled. its almost like being at a Japanese home in taste and presentation. Akitaya is a spot not to be missed it evokes the old a shitamatchi style a Tachinomi Place (standing Restaurant).
